# Security Configuration & Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures, configurations, and best practices implemented in the Marcel Expense Project.

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Protection
- ✅ `.env` files added to `.gitignore` (root, frontend, backend)
- ✅ `.env.example` templates provided for safe configuration sharing
- ✅ Sensitive data (API keys, database credentials) stored in environment variables
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in source code

### 2. Dependency Security
- ✅ Regular dependency auditing with `npm audit`
- ✅ Automated security scanning via GitHub Actions
- ✅ All known vulnerabilities fixed
- ✅ Security audit scripts added to package.json:
  - `npm run audit` - Run security audit
  - `npm run audit:fix` - Fix automatically fixable vulnerabilities
  - `npm run security:check` - Check for moderate+ severity issues

### 3. Code Security (ESLint Configuration)
- ✅ Security-focused ESLint rules implemented
- ✅ Protection against common vulnerabilities:
  - Object injection attacks
  - Unsafe regular expressions
  - Eval usage
  - Non-literal file system operations
  - Timing attacks
  - Pseudo-random number generation issues

### 4. Token Security
- ✅ Secure token storage with encryption
- ✅ Automatic token expiration
- ✅ Device fingerprinting for additional security
- ✅ Replaced all `localStorage` usage with encrypted storage

### 5. XSS Protection
- ✅ HTML sanitization utility implemented
- ✅ All `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage replaced with safe alternatives
- ✅ Input validation and output encoding

## 🛡️ Security Scripts

### Frontend
```bash
npm run audit          # Run dependency security audit
npm run audit:fix      # Fix vulnerabilities automatically
npm run security:check # Check for moderate+ severity issues
npm run lint           # Run ESLint with security rules
```

### Backend
```bash
npm run audit          # Run dependency security audit
npm run audit:fix      # Fix vulnerabilities automatically
npm run security:check # Check for moderate+ severity issues
```

## 🔄 Automated Security Scanning

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml`
- **Triggers**: 
  - Push to main/develop branches
  - Pull requests
  - Daily scheduled runs (2 AM UTC)
- **Checks**:
  - Dependency vulnerabilities
  - High/critical severity issues
  - Both frontend and backend

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Run `npm audit` in both frontend and backend
- [ ] Ensure no high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Run ESLint security checks
- [ ] Test secure token storage functionality

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Weekly dependency audits
- [ ] Monthly security rule updates
- [ ] Quarterly penetration testing
- [ ] Annual security review

## 🚨 Incident Response

### If Vulnerabilities Are Found
1. **Immediate**: Stop deployment if in progress
2. **Assess**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Fix**: Apply patches or workarounds
4. **Test**: Verify fixes don't break functionality
5. **Deploy**: Push security updates
6. **Document**: Update this security documentation

### Reporting Security Issues
- Create a private issue in the repository
- Include detailed description and reproduction steps
- Tag with `security` label
- Notify team leads immediately for critical issues

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### ESLint Security Rules
- Object injection detection
- Unsafe regex detection
- Eval usage prevention
- File system security
- Timing attack prevention
- Accessibility compliance

### Dependency Management
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Severity-based failure thresholds
- Regular update schedules
- Security-first dependency selection
